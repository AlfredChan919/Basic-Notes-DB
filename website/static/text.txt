when we submit this post, we send a POST to the backend


a POST request usually means youre making some kind of chanage toa  DB or a state of the page or website
so we would POST the fact that we are signing up or signing in with all the information of the page

GET request is getting information, POST request is giving information

data=request.form
    allows us to access the form data of the request
